  Summary

  This is a Python-based MCP server that enables sophisticated multi-agent orchestration within iTerm2. Key highlights:

  Core Purpose

  Controls iTerm2 terminal sessions via MCP protocol, allowing Claude Code instances and other AI agents to coordinate across multiple terminal panes.

  Architecture

  - Core modules (core/): Session management, terminal control, layouts, agents, teams, roles, memory, flows
  - Server (iterm_mcpy/): FastMCP implementation with 40+ tools + gRPC server
  - Tests: 23 test files with 98+ passing tests
