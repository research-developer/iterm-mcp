## 🎯 The Epic at a Glance

### Vision
Transform iTerm2 into a visual command center where multiple AI agents from different teams work together seamlessly, with the terminal pane hierarchy intuitively representing team structure.

### The Problem We're Solving
Current iterm-mcp has solid foundations (gRPC, agents, parallel ops) but lacks:
1. Visual clarity - can't see agent states at a glance
2. Intuitive hierarchy - panes don't reflect org structure
3. Rich coordination - basic messaging only
4. Self-healing - no automatic recovery
5. Executive interface - no orchestrator agent
6. Deep observability - hard to debug workflows
7. Security controls - insufficient isolation

### The Solution: 7 Sub-Issues

| # | Sub-Issue | Duration | Phase | Priority |
|---|-----------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Visual Hierarchy & Dynamic Layouts | 2 weeks | 1 | High |
| 2 | Real-Time Visual Status System | 2 weeks | 1 | High |
| 3 | Structured Inter-Agent Communication | 2 weeks | 2 | Medium |
| 4 | Health Monitoring & Auto-Recovery | 1 week | 3 | Medium |
| 5 | Executive Agent Interface | 2 weeks | 2 | High |
| 6 | Advanced Observability | 1 week | 3 | Low |
| 7 | Security & Isolation | 1 week | 4 | Medium |

**Total:** 7 weeks across 4 phases

### Key Innovation
**Leverage 80% more of iTerm2 Python API:**
- Currently using: basic session/command operations (~20%)
- Will add: 12 event monitors, colors, badges, status bars, variables, arrangements, broadcast domains, buried sessions

**Result:** Terminal becomes a visual organizational chart with real-time agent state, sophisticated coordination, and self-healing.

## 💡 Key Questions Answered

### Q: Why 7 sub-issues instead of fewer, larger issues?
**A:** Each sub-issue delivers standalone value and can be developed independently. Smaller scopes reduce risk and enable parallel development.

### Q: Why focus on visual features first (Phase 1)?
**A:** Visual feedback provides immediate user value and validates the approach. Communication/coordination builds on this foundation.

### Q: Can we do this without iTerm2? (Terminal agnostic?)
**A:** Not initially. iTerm2's API is uniquely powerful. We can design for portability, but implementation is iTerm2-specific.

### Q: What if we have 100+ agents?
**A:** Design targets 50 agents with testing to 100. Beyond that, we'd need paging/filtering or multi-window support (future work).

### Q: How does this compare to a web dashboard?
**A:** Web dashboards require context switching. This keeps developers in their native terminal environment. Both could coexist.

### Q: What happens to existing functionality?
**A:** Zero regressions. All current features remain. New capabilities are additive with feature flags.
