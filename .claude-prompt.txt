## Issue #61: Add Role-Based Session Specialization

## Summary
Implement role-based session specialization allowing sessions to be defined with professional roles (DevOps, Builder, Debugger) that influence available tools and behavior.

## Background
Role-based agent design is central to CrewAI and Agency Swarm:
- **CrewAI**: Agents receive dedicated roles, goals, and backstories
- **Agency Swarm**: Organizational structure metaphor (CEO, Developer, VA)
- Both use roles to guide behavior and tool access

## Proposed Implementation

### Role Definition
```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Optional

class SessionRole(Enum):
    DEVOPS = "devops"
    BUILDER = "builder"
    DEBUGGER = "debugger"
    RESEARCHER = "researcher"
    TESTER = "tester"

class RoleConfig(BaseModel):
    role: SessionRole
    description: str
    available_tools: List[str]
    default_commands: List[str] = []
    environment: dict = {}
```

### Session Configuration
```python
class SessionConfig(BaseModel):
    name: str
    agent: Optional[str] = None
    team: Optional[str] = None
    role: Optional[SessionRole] = None
    role_config: Optional[RoleConfig] = None
    
# Usage
session = SessionConfig(
    name="build-worker",
    agent="build-1",
    team="builders",
    role=SessionRole.BUILDER,
    role_config=RoleConfig(
        role=SessionRole.BUILDER,
        description="Handles npm builds and Docker containers",
        available_tools=["npm", "docker", "git"],
        default_commands=["cd /project", "nvm use 18"]
    )
)
```

### Role-Based Tool Filtering
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def execute_npm(command: str, session_target: SessionTarget):
    """Execute npm command. Only available to BUILDER role."""
    session = await resolve_session(session_target)
    if session.role not in [SessionRole.BUILDER, SessionRole.DEVOPS]:
        raise PermissionError("npm commands require BUILDER or DEVOPS role")
    ...
```

## Benefits
- **Clear specialization**: Sessions have defined capabilities
- **Tool restrictions**: Limit dangerous operations by role
- **Better coordination**: Orchestrator knows what each session can do
- **Self-documenting**: Roles describe session purpose

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SessionRole enum with common roles
- [ ] RoleConfig for detailed role configuration
- [ ] Role field on SessionConfig
- [ ] Optional tool filtering by role
- [ ] Documentation for role definitions
